One segmentation pattern of particular interest is for PCI-DSS compliance. Sections 1.2 and 1.3 of PCI-DSS require in-scope CDE traffic to be firewalled and segmented from all other connections. Traditionally, this was accomplished by using separate networks separated by traditional firewalls.
While it is certainly possible to repeat this pattern for cloud native applications, doing so will ultimately add more friction to the modern CI/CD and deployment pipelines, as well as increase costs and reduce resource utilization of separate clusters. This means all of the potential benefit of cloud-native applications will not be possible to be realized.
